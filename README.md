# Bitwise
#### The & (bitwise AND)   
takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers.  
The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1.   
If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0.  

**In C Programming, the bitwise AND operator is denoted by &.**  

Let us suppose the bitwise AND operation of two integers 12 and 25.

#### The | (bitwise OR)   
takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers.  
The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1.

**In C Programming, bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.  **

#### The ^ (bitwise XOR)   
takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers.  
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. 

**In C Programming, bitwise OR operator is denoted by ^. **

#### The << (left shift)  
takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.  

#### The >> (right shift) 
takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

#### The ~ (bitwise NOT)  
takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
