# Bitwise
#### The & (bitwise AND)   
Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers.  
The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1.   
If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0.  

Bitwise AND operator is denoted by &.  

 #### The | (bitwise OR)   
Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers.  
The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1.

Bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.   

#### The ^ (bitwise XOR)   
Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers.  
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. 

Bitwise OR operator is denoted by ^.

 #### The << (left shift)  
Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.  

#### The >> (right shift) 
Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

#### The ~ (bitwise NOT)  
Takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
